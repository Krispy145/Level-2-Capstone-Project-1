# Level 2: Capstone project 1

This application has been built for a theoretical company called *‘Poised’*. The application takes the form and functionality of a project management system developed in **Java language**.

The project includes contracts for different building design types, such as apartments etc, and the application tracks the tasks progress and details.

The program allows users to create and capture new projects for *‘Poised’* as well as being able to update relevant information on the project as required.

This relevant information includes creating and updating contractor, architect and customer details, as well as due dates and amounts owed/paid to/from the customer.

*Once projects have been finalised, the program will eventually be able to generates an invoice for the customer with the amount outstanding, if there is such.*

*The program, will also have the functionality to generate a list of all outstanding, incomplete and complete projects.*
